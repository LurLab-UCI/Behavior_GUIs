
Currently before any changes the punishment logic is as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------
 In the rate discrimination mode:

 if no_punish_condition is true
    
	no punishment, no reward, retrial
            
 else
         punishment and retrial
    
 end

 where  no_punish_condition is true 
       when training rate is selected and no_test_punishment is checked

-------------------------------------------------------

 In the side discrimination 6-panel mode:

In the non-retrial mode	
	 if wrong_lick_punishment is checked
		if no_punish_condition is true
			no punishment, no reward, new trial
		else
			punishment, new trial

	 if wrong_lick_punishment is NOT checked
		 new trial


In the retrial mode	

	 if wrong_lick_punishment is checked
		if no_punish_condition is true
			no punishment, no reward, new trial
		else
			punishment, new trial

	 if wrong_lick_punishment is NOT checked
		 new trial

		
 where  no_punish_condition is true 
       when light 0 or 7 not selected  and no_test_punishment is checked

-------------------------------------------------------

 In the side discrimination 2-panel mode:


In the non-retrial mode	
	 if wrong_lick_punishment is NOT checked
			keep waiting for correct lick

	 if wrong_lick_punishment is checked
		 punishment, new trial 



In the retrial mode	
	 if wrong_lick_punishment is NOT checked
		no punishment, no reward, re-trial

	 if wrong_lick_punishment is checked
		 punishment, re-trial
